        <p>My favorite hobby is reading, I like to read fantasy, realistic fiction, non-fiction and many other genres. I am not too picky about what I read. When I read I get lost in my own little world. I'll end up spending hours reading if no one stops me. With the right book and the right amount of time reading, anyone can enjoy reading! Reading keeps me busy and entertained. Thats why I love it.</p>
